Challenge : predict conversions 🏆🏆
In this project, you will participate to a machine learning competition like the ones that are organized by https://www.kaggle.com/. You will be able to work with jupyter notebooks as usual, but in the end you'll have to submit your model's predictions to your teacher/TA, so your model's performances will be evaluated in an independent way. The scores achieved by the different teams will be stored into a leaderboard 🏅🏅
