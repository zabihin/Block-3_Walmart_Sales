Walmart : predict weekly sales Company's Description 📇 Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores from the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962.

Project 🚧 Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

Goals 🎯 The project can be divided into three steps:

Part 1 : make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning

Part 2 : train a linear regression model (baseline)

Part 3: avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model Scope of this project 🖼️
